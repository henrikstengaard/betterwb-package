BetterWB release 4.0 (27th February 2015)
                            

Introduction:
 
This package is for those outcasts that still keep their Amigas in
their most basic configurations. It is also meant for those purists
that think that anything beyond 3.1 (be it AmigaOS 3.5, or even 3.9 
or 4.x) is a piece of crap and generates an overbloated system.
This is indeed a better AmigaOS 3.1 than 3.1 itself ;) 
 
"BetterWB" will provide you of a new and improved 3.1 experience, 
whilst remaining faithfull to the essential Commodore Amiga concepts.
It has no MUI and no ClassAct/ReAction dependencies which makes it 
less resource hungry.

Frequently asked questions
 
Q:Some Commodities dont work. What is going on? 
A:512KB is the minimum amount of memory BetterWB requires,  
so if you attempt to run many commodities at once, you can easily run 
out of it.
 
Q:Where is the eye candy I was expecting? 
A:BetterWB was not designed for visual enjoyment, as many other packs.
In fact, it looks similar to Workbench 3.1. Most of the changes it 
has, have been done "under the hood" to bugfix, enhance and upgrade 
AmigaOS 3.1, but remaining as conceptually loyal as possible to what 
Commodore did back in the golden years. The advantages of this 
approach are evident for those so called "purists" that dont want an 
overbloated system, and for Amiga users that dont want to buy new 
hardware just to have an improved/updated AmigaOS experience in their 
old and beloved hardware. That said, you can improve the appeareance 
of workbench by using IconSet, and switching icons to GlowIcons, and 
following the tips it will provide. I also recommend you play a bit 
enabling more commodities until you get the desired effect.
 
Q:Will I be able to use harddrives bigger than 4GB?  
A:Yes, you need to update your FastFileSystem in your harddrive´s RDB 
using HDToolBox or similar application. Any devices that you mount 
manually should automatically use the patched FFS, assuming this new 
FFS has the same filename as the original used to have. Beware that 
some old programs are not compilant with the New Style Device 
standard (Quarterback, DiskSalv, ReOrg). Do not use them in the 4GB 
side of your drive. Maximum supported size is now 8GB, so be careful.
When formatting any drive, just take care of never creating partitions
of more than 2GB in size. 
An overall better solution is to use the excellent Professional File 
System (PFS) which is also included in this pack, which can support 
bigger drives without any problems (and it will also be faster and 
less memory hungry).
 
Q:Where can I find documentation for all this BetterWB thing? 
A:All individual readme files and amigaguide documents are inside 
SYS:Locale/Help/ drawer (Help: volume) and can be easily be viewed 
with "Multiview".

Q:After installing BetterWB, my Amiga doesnt properly boot. What`s 
wrong?
A: The installation script assumes you are installing BetterWB on a
fresh AmigaOS 3.1 install. You should not tweak your workbench at all
before installing BetterWB. But, dont be afraid to adjust and modify 
your workbench to suit your tastes after installing BetterWB.

Q:Why doesnt ACDPlay work?
A:You need to adjust your cdrom tooltypes to match your drive 
unit and device name.

Q:Why does ModeProPrefs/MagicMenuPrefs/CronPrefs complain when I run 
it?
A:Because it requires that you move the corresponding commodity 
to the WBStartup drawer. I recommend you use the WBstartup 
preferences program to easily accomplish this task.

Q:Why does BootUte issue a recoverable alert (yellow guru) when I 
run it?
This is because you are running it in a system that has only 512KB of
chipmem. BootUte is envisioned in BetterWB to be an enhanced 
replacement of the NoFastMem program. So it is of little or no use in 
running it in a System with no fastmem. 

Q:How do I get rid of those ugly icon borders? 
Just use your WBStartup prefs utility and enable the DontShowIBorder 
commodity. Reboot and you are done!

Q:Why do GlowIcons, NewIcons, etc. look colorless on Workbench?
You need to use your Screenmode prefs program and select more 
colors than what you already have.

Kudos go to those developers that created all these programs. 
BetterWB only exists because of them!
 
I wish to remain anonymous, this is just 
a labour of love for the Amiga.
